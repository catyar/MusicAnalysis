Project objective: You need to make a pitch to the Marketing and Sales Teams to focus on Artists in a particular genre for a new ad campaign to increase sales and visibility. To help them understand the numbers and sales performance in a more visual way, you will create a dashboard for the teams to interact.


This project was completed as part of Virginia Tech's Data Analytics Bootcamp. This project was aimed at using our knowledge of SQL, Python, and Tableau to teach fundamental tools within Tableau as well as build a workflow for analysis.
